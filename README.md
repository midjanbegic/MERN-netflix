# MERN
This repository represents my MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project inspired by the Netflix platform. Within this project, I utilized Redux Toolkit for state management, Firebase for authentication and data storage, Styled Components for component styling, Axios for API communication, and Node.js and Express for building the server.
